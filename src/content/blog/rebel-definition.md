# My Definition of a 'Rebel'

## Proposed Definition:
A "rebel" is an individual who consistently exhibits behaviors or characteristics that deliberately challenge societal norms, resulting in observable actions aimed at disrupting or altering the established systems of their environment.

## Key Components:

1. **Observable Behaviors**: 
   - Actions or patterns of conduct that can be empirically noted
   - No moral judgment on whether these behaviors are "good" or "bad"

2. **Deliberate Challenge to Norms**:
   - Behaviors or characteristics that intentionally defy what is typical or expected in the given society
   - This defiance is substantial enough to be readily apparent to others

3. **Active Disruption**:
   - Engages in activities aimed at altering or opposing common societal structures (e.g., political systems, economic models, social hierarchies)
   - These activities are externally visible and not based solely on internal dissatisfaction

4. **Systemic Critique and Alternative Proposition**:
   - Demonstrates ability to identify and articulate perceived flaws in established systems
   - Often proposes or attempts to create alternative structures or methodologies

5. **Consistency**:
   - The behaviors and actions are not isolated incidents but form a pattern over time
   - The individual consistently acts against societal expectations in various contexts

6. **Context-Dependent**:
   - Recognition that what constitutes a "rebel" may vary between different societies or systems
   - The definition applies within the context of the specific environment the individual challenges

## Observable Indicators:

- Frequent confrontations with authority figures or institutions
- Deliberate and recurring violations of social norms or laws
- Persistent engagement in activist or revolutionary activities
- Consistent efforts to mobilize others against established systems
- Regular production or distribution of materials critical of the status quo
- Visible participation in or leadership of counter-cultural movements
- Repeated attempts to establish or promote alternative societal structures

## Important Considerations:

1. This definition focuses on external observations and does not account for internal motivations or moral justifications.
2. It does not make judgments about the validity or morality of the rebel's actions or the societal norms being challenged.
3. The term "rebel" is used descriptively, not pejoratively or admiringly, in this context.
4. This definition allows for the possibility that an individual might be a "rebel" in one system but not in another.
5. It acknowledges that societal norms and systems can change over time, potentially altering who might be considered a "rebel."
