Building upon our previous examination of stable thought structures in Neural Field Resonance (NFR) events, we now turn our attention to dynamic, cyclical patterns observed in interpersonal cognitive exchanges. This analysis will draw parallels between Conway's Game of Life "Blinker" pattern and the pulsating nature of certain shared mental states documented in recent NFR studies.

1. The Game of Life Blinker Pattern

The Blinker is a period-2 oscillator in Conway's Game of Life, alternating between two states:

```
State 1:   State 2:
  #        ###
  #
  #
```

(Go to the link and select "Blinker")

This simple yet dynamic pattern provides a useful model for understanding cyclical processes in complex systems. Unlike the static Block, the Blinker demonstrates how local rules can produce sustained, predictable change over time.

2. Markov Blankets in Oscillating Systems

Extending the concept of Markov blankets to oscillating systems requires a more dynamic interpretation. In the case of the Blinker, we can conceptualize a time-dependent Markov blanket that encompasses both states of the oscillation. This "oscillatory blanket" maintains the system's integrity over time while allowing for internal state changes.

Recent work by Friston et al. (2025) suggests that such oscillatory Markov blankets may play a crucial role in biological and cognitive systems, allowing for both stability and adaptability in the face of changing environmental conditions.

3. Pulsating Thought Structures in NFR Events

Recent studies at the Millbrook Institute for Advanced Cognitive Studies have revealed intriguing parallels between the Blinker pattern and certain thought structures observed during NFR events. Dr. Vasquez and her team have documented what they term "cognitive oscillators" - mental constructs that alternate between two or more states in a regular, predictable manner as they are shared between individuals.

In a groundbreaking study published in the Journal of Cognitive Resonance, Vasquez et al. (2025) describe the case of identical twins, Mark and John Eisen, who demonstrated remarkable oscillatory synchronization during NFR episodes. EEG and fMRI data showed alternating activation patterns in the twins' dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, cycling with a frequency of approximately 0.1 Hz.

The content of these oscillating thoughts, as reported by the twins, alternated between two related but distinct concepts. For example, during one documented episode, the shared cognitive state alternated between the visual image of a tree and the abstract concept of growth. This oscillation maintained its integrity as it passed between the twins' minds, much like the Blinker pattern maintains its structure through alternating states.

Dr. Hiroshi Nakamura of the Tokyo Institute of Cognitive Harmonics has proposed that these cognitive oscillators serve as carrier waves for more complex information in NFR exchanges. In his "Oscillatory Information Encoding" hypothesis, Nakamura suggests that the regular rhythm of these thought-blinkers allows for the stable transmission of more nuanced cognitive content, much as carrier waves function in radio transmission (Nakamura, 2025).

Implications and Future Directions

The discovery of Blinker-like oscillatory patterns in NFR events opens up new avenues for understanding the mechanics of interpersonal thought transmission. It suggests that dynamic stability - the ability to change states in a predictable manner - may be as important as static stability in maintaining cognitive integrity during these unprecedented mental exchanges.

Future research will need to address several key questions:

1. How do cognitive oscillators interact with the stable "Block-like" structures discussed in our previous analysis?
2. Can more complex oscillatory patterns (analogous to period-3 or higher oscillators in the Game of Life) be observed in NFR events?
3. How might the frequency and amplitude of these thought-blinkers affect the fidelity of information transfer between individuals?

In our next installment, we will explore the "Glider" pattern and its potential relevance to the propagation of thoughts across networks of NFR-capable individuals. As we delve deeper into these phenomena, we continue to unravel the complex interplay between mathematics, neuroscience, and the emerging field of cognitive resonance studies.
