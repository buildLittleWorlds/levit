# My Definition of a 'Monster'

## Proposed Definition:
A "monster" is an individual who consistently exhibits behaviors or characteristics that significantly deviate from societal norms, resulting in observable difficulties in integration and function within the established systems of their environment.

## Key Components:

1. **Observable Behaviors**: 
   - Actions or patterns of conduct that can be empirically noted
   - No moral judgment on whether these behaviors are "good" or "bad"

2. **Significant Deviation from Norms**:
   - Behaviors or characteristics that noticeably differ from what is typical in the given society
   - This deviation is substantial enough to be readily apparent to others

3. **Difficulty in Integration**:
   - Challenges in adapting to or participating in common societal structures (e.g., work, education, social interactions)
   - These difficulties are externally visible and not based on internal experiences

4. **Systemic Dysfunction**:
   - Inability or struggle to operate effectively within the established systems of the environment
   - This dysfunction is consistent across multiple aspects of societal engagement

5. **Consistency**:
   - The behaviors and difficulties are not isolated incidents but form a pattern over time
   - The individual consistently struggles to align with societal expectations in various contexts

6. **Context-Dependent**:
   - Recognition that what constitutes a "monster" may vary between different societies or systems
   - The definition applies within the context of the specific environment the individual inhabits

## Observable Indicators:

- Frequent conflicts with authority figures or institutions
- Recurring violations of social norms or unwritten rules
- Persistent inability to maintain employment or education
- Consistent difficulty in forming or maintaining social relationships
- Regular interventions by social services or law enforcement
- Visible social isolation or exclusion from community activities
- Repeated failures to meet societal milestones or expectations

## Important Considerations:

1. This definition focuses on external observations and does not account for internal experiences or motivations.
2. It does not make judgments about the validity or morality of societal norms themselves.
3. The term "monster" is used descriptively, not pejoratively, in this context.
4. This definition allows for the possibility that an individual might be a "monster" in one system but not in another.
5. It acknowledges that societal norms and systems can change over time, potentially altering who might be considered a "monster."
