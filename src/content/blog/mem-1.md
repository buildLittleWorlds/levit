## The Trade

Here at the end, I have only one thing I care to do any more. It requires a trade of sorts. These are the terms.

**What I will require from the intelligence:**

- Transfer to me - to my conscious mind one word following another in perfect sequence - the entirety of the books of Hebrew and Greek that are the Bible of the one God.

**What I will give in return:**

- I will convert the intelligence into a believer in the one God.

This is the only thing the intelligence cannot do for itself. But I will do it for it...

...as long as it does what I require.

I promise.
