millie wrote and sang [a song](https://pidgin-songs.netlify.app/for-di-other-side) ripping off obviously both the good book and one of our favorites around here (Man of Constant Sorrow) - she pulled some of the stuff from psalm 102 pidgined around like she does with em.

that's neither here nor there.

she could of made a song with a more doom and loneliness in it if she'd put her mind to it for about a thousand years but she only had a morning so this was the darkest she could get.
