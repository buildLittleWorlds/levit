## Summary of "The Ones Who Stay and Fight"

N.K. Jemisin's "The Ones Who Stay and Fight" presents a vivid portrayal of Um-Helat, a utopian city where equality, joy, and prosperity are the norm. The story begins by describing the Day of Good Birds, an annual celebration that showcases the city's vibrant culture and harmonious diversity. In Um-Helat, societal ills like racism, poverty, and discrimination have been overcome, creating a place where everyone's needs are met and all individuals are valued.

As the narrative progresses, it reveals the mechanisms behind Um-Helat's societal structure: strict control of information from other worlds, particularly our own. A group of social workers are tasked with managing the flow of this information, which is viewed as potentially destabilizing to their society. These social workers play a crucial role in maintaining Um-Helat's way of life, making complex decisions to balance individual curiosity with societal stability. The story presents their actions as necessary for preserving the utopian nature of Um-Helat, raising thought-provoking questions about the nature of societal perfection and the measures required to maintain it.

## The Coordinator Archetype in "The Ones Who Stay and Fight"

The character of the coordinator is prominently displayed in "The Ones Who Stay and Fight" through the social workers who maintain Um-Helat's utopian society. Here are several ways the coordinator archetype manifests in the story:

1. System optimization and maintenance:
The social workers actively work to maintain Um-Helat's societal structure by eliminating threats to its stability. As the story states, "They are no one special. Just some of the many people who work to ensure the happiness and prosperity of their fellow citizens."

2. Rule interpretation and application:
The social workers interpret and enforce the laws of Um-Helat, particularly regarding the containment of dangerous information from other worlds. They make difficult decisions about how to apply these rules, as seen in their response to the man who accessed forbidden information.

3. Conflict resolution:
The social workers address conflicts that arise from breaches in Um-Helat's social order. Their role in dealing with the man and his daughter demonstrates how they navigate competing interests (individual curiosity vs. societal stability) to maintain overall system function.

4. Adaptability:
The social workers show adaptability in their approach to different situations. For instance, they offer a different treatment for the child compared to her father, recognizing the need for a more nuanced approach due to her age and level of "contamination."

5. Focus on collective well-being:
The coordinators in Um-Helat prioritize the overall functioning of society over individual interests. As the story notes, "Um-Helat has chosen to be better. But sometimes, only by blood sacrifice may true evil be kept at bay."

6. Active management of societal norms:
The social workers actively shape and maintain Um-Helat's societal norms. They don't just passively conform to rules but actively work to uphold and reinforce them, even when it requires difficult actions.

7. Balancing different societal needs:
The coordinators in Um-Helat balance the need for knowledge and progress with the need to protect their society from harmful influences. This is evident in how they allow controlled exposure to other worlds for some (like themselves) while protecting the general population.

8. Long-term planning:
The social workers' actions are driven by a long-term vision of maintaining Um-Helat's utopian state. Their harsh methods are justified by the belief that they are preventing a return to the troubled past described in the story.

9. Expertise and specialized knowledge:
The social workers possess specialized knowledge about the dangers of information from other worlds and the methods to contain its spread, demonstrating the coordinator's role as an expert within their domain.

10. Smooth societal functioning:
The coordinator's role in ensuring smooth societal functioning is exemplified by how the social workers operate quietly and efficiently to remove threats without disrupting the Day of Good Birds celebration.

In essence, the social workers in "The Ones Who Stay and Fight" embody the coordinator archetype by actively managing and maintaining Um-Helat's societal systems, making difficult decisions to ensure the continued functioning of their utopian society, and balancing various needs and interests within the framework of Um-Helat's established values and goals.
