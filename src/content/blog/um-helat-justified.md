## 1. Introduction and Summary

N.K. Jemisin's "The Ones Who Stay and Fight" presents a thought-provoking exploration of utopia and the ethical implications of maintaining such a society. The story begins by painting a vivid picture of Um-Helat, a city where equality, joy, and prosperity reign supreme. We're introduced to the Day of Good Birds, an annual celebration that showcases the city's vibrant culture and harmonious diversity.

In Um-Helat, societal ills like racism, poverty, and discrimination have been overcome. The city is described as a place "where no one hungers, no one is left ill, no one lives in fear, and even war is almost forgotten." This utopian society seems to have achieved what many would consider impossible: true equality and universal prosperity.

However, the narrative takes a sharp turn when it reveals the hidden mechanism behind Um-Helat's perfection: strict control of information from other worlds, particularly our own. A group of social workers are tasked with eliminating those who access and spread this information, viewing it as a dangerous contagion that could undermine their society. This revelation forces readers to grapple with difficult questions about the nature of utopia and the moral cost of maintaining it.

## 2. The Story's Perspective

The story presents a clear and unapologetic stance on the actions of the social workers. As the narrator states, "Sometimes, only by blood sacrifice may true evil be kept at bay." This powerful assertion frames their actions not as morally ambiguous, but as necessary and justified measures to protect Um-Helat's way of life. The use of the term "evil" to describe the ideas from our world underscores the perceived threat and the moral imperative to combat it.

The narrator reinforces this viewpoint by describing the spread of information from our world in stark, medical terms: "The disease has taken one poor victim, but it need not claim more." This language portrays the social workers not as oppressors, but as healers, preventing the spread of a dangerous infection. The choice of words like "disease" and "claim" emphasizes the perceived inevitability of harm if these ideas are allowed to proliferate, thereby justifying the extreme measures taken to contain them.

The story's stance is perhaps most clearly articulated in the statement, "Um-Helat has chosen to be better." This simple yet powerful declaration positions the city's methods, including the violent suppression of certain knowledge, as a conscious and morally superior choice. It suggests that the rigorous control of information, far from being a necessary evil, is in fact an integral part of what makes Um-Helat "better" than our world.

## 3. Potential Objections

A reader might raise several objections to the methods employed by Um-Helat to maintain its utopia:

1. **Violation of Human Rights**: The idea of killing people for accessing or spreading information, regardless of its nature, could be seen as a fundamental violation of human rights. One might argue that a truly utopian society should respect individual freedoms, including the freedom of information and thought.

2. **Resilience of Ideals**: A critic might contend that a truly utopian society should be able to withstand exposure to different ideas without resorting to lethal force. If Um-Helat's ideals are so fragile that they cannot survive contact with alternative viewpoints, are they really as robust and superior as claimed?

3. **Ethical Consistency**: There's a potential contradiction in using violence and oppression to maintain a society supposedly free of these very ills. How can Um-Helat claim moral superiority when it resorts to tactics that it ostensibly opposes?

4. **Informed Consent**: The citizens of Um-Helat, particularly the younger ones, are not given a choice about whether to participate in this system. They are shielded from certain knowledge without their consent, raising questions about autonomy and free will.

5. **Potential for Abuse**: The system in place could be susceptible to abuse. Who decides what information is dangerous? How can the citizens be sure that the social workers are not overstepping their authority or manipulating the system for their own benefit?

## 4. The Story's Response

The story anticipates and addresses such objections, presenting a staunch defense of Um-Helat's methods:

1. **Necessity of Extreme Measures**: The narrator asks, "Is not the alternative to lie helpless, spotty and blistered and heaving, until we all die?" This rhetorical question presents the social workers' actions as the only viable alternative to societal collapse. It suggests that the stakes are so high that conventional notions of human rights must be superseded for the greater good.

2. **Inherent Toxicity of Certain Ideas**: The story frames the information from our world as inherently toxic: "Poor child. She is nearly septic with the taint of our world." This suggests that exposure to such ideas is not merely a difference of opinion, but a form of contamination that threatens the very fabric of Um-Helat's society. The use of medical terminology like "septic" and "taint" reinforces the idea that these thoughts are not just different, but actively harmful.

3. **Moral Imperative**: The narrator implicates the reader in this ethical dilemma: "You also have to fight for her, now that you know she exists, or walking away is meaningless." This statement suggests that once aware of the stakes, inaction becomes a form of complicity. It challenges the reader to consider whether they would be willing to make difficult choices to preserve a better world.

4. **Historical Context**: The story provides context for Um-Helat's choices: "Um-Helat has been a worse place, after all, in its past." This implies that the city's current methods are a response to historical struggles and hard-learned lessons. It suggests that the social workers' actions, while extreme, are rooted in a deep understanding of the fragility of social progress.

5. **Redefinition of Freedom**: The story posits that true freedom might look different from what we typically imagine: "Everyone—even the poor, even the lazy, even the undesirable—can matter." This suggests that Um-Helat offers a form of freedom and equality that surpasses anything in our world, potentially justifying the measures taken to preserve it.

## 5. Conclusion

"The Ones Who Stay and Fight" presents a challenging perspective on the maintenance of utopia. It argues that the preservation of a truly just and equitable society may require extreme measures, including the violent suppression of harmful ideas. While this stance may be uncomfortable for many readers, the story presents it as a necessary and even noble choice.

The narrative forces us to grapple with difficult questions: Is a perfect society worth such a price? Can true equality and prosperity only be achieved through rigid control of information? What responsibilities do we bear once we become aware of such dilemmas?

Ultimately, the story doesn't provide easy answers. Instead, it challenges readers to critically examine their own beliefs about society, progress, and the lengths to which one might go to create and maintain a better world. It suggests that the path to utopia may be far more complex and morally ambiguous than we might hope, forcing us to confront uncomfortable truths about the nature of social change and the price of perfection.

By presenting this ethical quandary in the context of a richly imagined utopian society, Jemisin creates a powerful thought experiment that lingers long after the story ends. It invites ongoing discussion and debate about the nature of progress, the limits of tolerance, and the moral compromises we might be willing to make in pursuit of a better world.
