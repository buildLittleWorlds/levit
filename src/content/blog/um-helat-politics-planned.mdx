## Political Structure Template for Um-Helat:

1. Government Format:
   - Decentralized community-based governance with emphasis on consensus decision-making. Local councils handle day-to-day operations, while city-wide issues are addressed through direct democracy mechanisms. Citizens are encouraged to participate actively in governance through regular town halls, online platforms, and community initiatives.

   - Technocratic meritocracy guided by advanced AI systems. Leadership positions are filled based on expertise and proven ability. The AI assists in policy analysis, resource allocation, and long-term planning, but final decisions rest with human leaders to maintain ethical oversight.

2. Law Enforcement and Social Order:
   - A specialized group of social workers, trained in conflict resolution, psychology, and ethics, serve as the primary peacekeepers. They have the authority to intervene in social issues, mediate conflicts, and in extreme cases, remove individuals who pose a threat to societal harmony. These workers undergo rigorous ethical training and are subject to regular psychological evaluations.

   - An advanced surveillance system monitors public spaces for potential threats or emergencies. The system is designed to protect privacy while allowing rapid response to crimes or accidents. Citizens have the right to access their own data and can challenge any perceived misuse of the system.

3. Information Control and Education:
   - A carefully curated educational system that teaches citizens about the city's history, including past mistakes and the reasons for current societal structures. Certain historical information is presented only when citizens reach specific age milestones, ensuring they have the emotional and intellectual maturity to process complex ethical issues.

   - Strict regulations on inter-dimensional information exchange. A specialized task force monitors and controls any data or communication from parallel worlds, particularly those considered less socially advanced. Access to this information is heavily restricted due to its potential to disrupt social harmony.

4. Economic and Social Welfare:
   - Post-scarcity economy enabled by advanced technology and resource management. Basic needs such as food, housing, healthcare, and education are guaranteed for all citizens. Luxury goods and services are available through a merit-based system that rewards societal contributions.

   - Comprehensive social support system that includes mental health services, addiction treatment, and rehabilitation programs. Citizens struggling with social integration or mental health issues are provided with intensive, personalized care aimed at reintegration rather than punishment.

5. Citizenship Rights and Responsibilities:
   - Universal rights to housing, healthcare, education, and participation in governance. These rights come with the responsibility to contribute to society, whether through work, community service, or creative pursuits.

   - Mandatory ethics and critical thinking education for all citizens, with ongoing refresher courses throughout adulthood. This education emphasizes the importance of social harmony, diversity, and the potential dangers of certain ideologies.

6. Conflict Resolution and Justice:
   - Multi-tiered system of conflict resolution, starting with community mediation and escalating to city-wide arbitration for more serious cases. Emphasis is placed on restorative justice and rehabilitation rather than punishment.

   - For extreme cases that pose an existential threat to societal harmony, a final option of permanent removal exists. This measure is used only in cases where all other attempts at rehabilitation and reintegration have failed, and the individual continues to pose a serious threat to the well-being of others.
