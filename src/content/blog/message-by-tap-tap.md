all the music here first was somewhere else. by this we mean real people somewhere else that wrote words down. and we mean thoughts we shared between us.

this is the tap-tap. we speak by tap-tap. sometimes moose walks by the shop and taps the front door tap-tap and inside the message bounces around.

some people call it telepathy. we call it tap-tap.
