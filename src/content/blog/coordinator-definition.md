# My Definition of a 'Coordinator'

## Proposed Definition:
A "coordinator" is an individual who actively implements and maintains processes and procedures that align with the established values and goals of a society or system, prioritizing overall societal function over individual outcomes.

## Key Components:

1. **Process Implementation**: 
   - Observable actions to create, maintain, and optimize societal procedures
   - Focus on systemic efficiency rather than individual accommodations

2. **Alignment with Societal Values**:
   - Demonstrable understanding and application of the society's established norms and objectives
   - Decision-making consistently reflects these societal priorities

3. **Impartial Execution**:
   - Willingness to enact measures that may be difficult for some individuals if deemed necessary for societal function
   - Absence of visible bias towards individual satisfaction over systemic needs

4. **System-Level Optimization**:
   - Actions taken to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of societal processes
   - Focus on group-level outcomes rather than individual-level outcomes

5. **Regulatory Function**:
   - Visible involvement in enforcing societal norms and procedures
   - Implementation of corrective measures when individual actions misalign with societal goals

6. **Adaptability**:
   - Observable ability to adjust processes in response to changing societal requirements
   - Flexibility in applying different strategies to maintain overall system function

## Observable Indicators:

- Implementation of standardized procedures across various societal domains
- Consistent application of rules or norms, even when resulting in difficult individual outcomes
- Regular assessment and adjustment of societal processes for efficiency
- Visible prioritization of group-level metrics over individual satisfaction measures
- Enforcement of consequences for actions that disrupt societal functioning
- Creation or maintenance of structures that reinforce societal values and goals
- Measurable improvements in societal-level indicators following coordinator interventions

## Important Considerations:

1. This definition focuses on observable actions and outcomes, not internal motivations or personal beliefs of the coordinator.
2. It does not make moral judgments about the societal values being upheld or the methods used to maintain them.
3. The term "coordinator" describes a role or function, not necessarily a formal position within the society.
4. This role may involve making or supporting decisions that are unpopular with some individuals but deemed necessary for societal function.
5. The effectiveness of a coordinator may be measured by overall societal stability and function, not by individual-level satisfaction or outcomes.
6. This definition allows for the possibility that coordination methods may vary depending on the nature and needs of the specific society.
7. It acknowledges that the role of a coordinator may involve enforcing or supporting punitive measures if aligned with societal values and goals.
